# Overview of the Project

W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

# Results


# June vs December


In this challenge, the goal was to evaluate the weather at the peak of summer and the peak of winter in order to address sustainability.

# June (Peak of Summer)

# Summary
Based on our data analysis, the mean temperature difference between June and December is only 4 degrees (~75 degrees vs. ~71 degrees). This variance should not greatly impact the ability to surf or the desire to consume ice cream.

The max temperature is even less remarkable, being only 2 degrees different between June and December.  Although cold days happened in December, the temperature in June and December are pretty similar and looks comfortable for surfing.
